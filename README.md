# inaturalist-website-scrape
This is a short script to scrape the first 100 pages of the inaturalist website for several pieces of data, and add
the information to a database.
At the bottom of the script, commented out, are a few SQL statements that can be run to select the species, contributor,
and location that are most frequently cited.
